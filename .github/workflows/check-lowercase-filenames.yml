name: Check Lowercase Filenames
# see issue #82
# "So I changed all the filenames containing capital letters to lower case.
# However, since the initial opening of this ticket, more files with upper case letter had been added. I renamed them too.
# But this shows that we need a systematic solution to this, otherwise we will run into this problem again and again.
# Could a check like this be done with GitHub Actions?"
