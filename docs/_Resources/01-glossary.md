## A
* **Archive:** an organisation, place or collection that stores information for long-term preservation so that it can be accessed and reused by a designated community.
* **Audit trail:** all previous versions of a note are saved and changes are logged.

## B
* **Backup:** practice of keeping extra copies of your research data in a separate physical or cloud location from your storage files.

## C
* **Controlled vocabulary:** a standardised and organised arrangement of words and phrases used to index and/or retrieve content through browsing and searching. A controlled vocabulary contains predefined, preferred and variant terms and is therefore used to describe a particular domain of knowledge (i.e. it has a defined scope). The use of a controlled vocabulary during the creation of data or metadata supports consistency and accuracy. The terms are usually presented in an alphabetical list of terms and include authority files, taxonomies, term lists and thesauri.
* **Custom code & scripts:** text-based commands used via a command-line interface.

## D
* **Data anonymization:** processing of personal data in which direct and indirect personal identifiers are completely and irreversibly removed. 
* **Data interoperability:** ability of a dataset to work with other datasets or systems without special effort on the part of the user.
* **Data Management Plan (DMP):** a formal and living document that defines responsibilities and provides guidance. It describes data and data management during the project and measures for archiving and making data and research results available, usable and understandable after the project has ended.
* **Data Protection Officer:** person who oversees the application of and compliance with regulations designed to protect important information from corruption, compromise or loss within an organisation
* **Data pseudonymization:** processing of personal data where the majority of identifying fields are replaced by pseudonyms (i.e. artificial identifiers).
* **Data repository:** a place where digital objects are stored and documented, and where these objects can be separately published and archived. Access to the data can be either open or restricted to a group of users.
* **Data Steward:** an expert in the preparation and management of data, including data selection, storage, preservation, annotation, provenance and other metadata maintenance, and dissemination.
* **Digital preservation:** the act of ensuring the continued findability and accessibility of digital material and keeping it independently understandable and reusable by a designated community, with evidence of its authenticity, for as long as necessary.
* **Documentation:** one or more documents that accompany your data/code and describe the details of the data/code and how/why it was generated.
* **Dublin Core:** domain-agnostic, basic, widely used metadata standard.

## E
* **Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN):** software meant to document experiments and research data.

## F
* **FAIR data principles:** domain-agnostic, basic, widely used metadata standard.

## G
* **git-annex:** distributed file synchronization system allowing to manage large files with git, without storing the file contents in git.
* **Good Scientific Practice (GSP):** principles, values and standards of behavior and practice that must be achieved and maintained in the delivery of work activities, the provision of care and personal conduct.

## I
* **Identifiable natural person:**  person who can directly or indirectly be identified with the help of an (online) identifier.
* **Informed consent:** process by which a subject voluntarily confirms their willingness to participate in a particular trial, after having been informed of all aspects of the trial that are relevant to the subject's decision to participate. Informed consent is documented by means of a written, signed and dated informed consent form.

## L
* **Literate programming:** code intermingled within a narrative of the scientific analysis.

## M
* **Metadata:** data about data.

## N
* **Narrative description:** detailed, written description of computational analyses.

## O
* **Ontology:** a list of terms with curated textual definitions with persistent identifiers. The terms are arranged hierarchically from general to more specific and have defined relationships to other terms within the ontology and to external resources (e.g., synonyms, cross-references).
* **Open Science:** make publicly funded research results (e.g. publications, research data, processes) publicly and freely accessible in digital formats under terms that enable reuse, redistribution and reproduction of the research and its underlying data and methods.
* **Open source software:** software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.

## P
* **Persistent Identifier (PID):** globally unique, actionable and machine-resolvable strings that act as a long-lasting reference to a digital object (e.g. a dataset).
* **Personal data:** any information associated with an identified or identifiable natural person (i.e. ‘data subject’).
* **Preregistration:** practice of documenting your research plan (i.e. research question and study design) before conducting a scientific investigation, and depositing that plan in a read-only public repository.
* **PUBLISSO – Repository Finder:** ZB MED’s curated selection of repositories from re3data.

## R
* **RDMO4Life:** dedicated version of RDMO for all research institutions that work in the field of life sciences. Possibility of customizing questionnaires to subject/project specific needs.
* **Research Data Management Organiser (RDMO):** open-source web application that supports the structured and collective planning and implementation of research data management and additionally enables the textual output of a data management plan.

## S
* **Storage:** act of keeping your research data in a secure location that you can access readily.

## V
* **Version Control Systems (VCSs):** software tools that help teams manage changes to file(s) over time. 

## W
* **Workflow management system (WMS):** software tool designed to help streamline routine processes for optimal efficiency.
